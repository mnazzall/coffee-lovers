                Coffee has a rich and fascinating history that dates back centuries. It is believed to have originated in the Ethiopian highlands, where legend has it that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing effects of coffee beans after noticing his goats becoming more lively after consuming them. From Ethiopia, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where it became an integral part of Islamic culture and was cultivated in Yemen.

                By the 15th century, coffee had made its way to the Middle East, where it was brewed in coffeehouses known as qahveh khaneh. These establishments became popular social hubs for intellectual discussions, music, and poetry. Coffeehouses soon spread to Europe in the 17th century, where they were initially met with suspicion but eventually gained popularity as centers of social interaction and business.
